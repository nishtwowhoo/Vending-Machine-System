# Vending-Machine-System
This project is a console-based vending machine system developed in C, simulating an automated beverage and snack dispenser.

Features
✔ Product Selection: Choose from 11 different beverages and snacks.
✔ Input Validation: Ensures correct product IDs (1–11), positive quantities, and sufficient payment.
✔ Shopping Cart: Tracks selected items, quantities, and prices using arrays and structs.
✔ Payment Handling: Calculates total cost, accepts money, and returns change.
✔ Receipt Generation: Displays purchased items, total cost, amount paid, and change.

Technologies Used
C Programming (structs, arrays, loops, input validation)

Modular Design (separate functions for menu display, payment, and receipt generation)
